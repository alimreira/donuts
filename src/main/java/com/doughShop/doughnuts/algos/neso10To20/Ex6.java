         * Iteration 2: num % 10 is 2, sum becomes 5, then num becomes 1.
         * Iteration 3: num % 10 is 1, sum becomes 6, then num becomes 0.
         * Exit Condition: Since num is now 0, it exits the loop.
         * If you used num >= 0, the loop would run again:
         *
         * Iteration 4: num is 0, sum stays 6, then num remains 0.
         * Loop continues infinitely since num remains 0.
         * So, using num > 0 avoids unnecessary extra iterations and ensures you only process the digits that contribute to the sum.*/
